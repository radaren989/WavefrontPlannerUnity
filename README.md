Wavefront Planner
This is a project I created to learn about Unity and pathfinding algorithms. The Wavefront Planner is a common method used in robotics and autonomous vehicles to navigate through a known environment.

Overview
The Wavefront Planner works by creating a grid map of the environment, where each cell is assigned a value based on its proximity to the goal. Starting from the goal, the planner uses the values in the grid to determine the optimal path to the destination.

In this project, I implemented the Wavefront Planner algorithm in Unity using C#. The user can specify the start and goal positions in the environment, and the planner will generate a path between them.

Features
Grid-based pathfinding algorithm
Visual representation of the environment and path
Start and goal position selection
Smooth path interpolation
Usage
To use this project, simply download or clone the repository and open it in Unity. The main scene is located in the Assets/Scenes folder. You can adjust the environment settings and obstacle placement in the scene editor.
